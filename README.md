# Lab 14: Data Visualization

In this lab, we will analyze a dataset provided by X company and visualize various relationships and insights using graphs.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset (`data.csv`)[dataset](https://github.com/LTUC/amman-python-401d12/blob/main/class-14/lab/data.csv) contains information about customers, including their age, income, marital status, educational background, and purchasing behavior for different products.

## Data Cleaning

We start by handling null values in the dataset and ensuring that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

## Outlier Detection

We visualize any outliers in the dataset using box plots to identify any values that are located far away from the mean.

## Correlation Analysis

We calculate the correlation coefficients between variables to understand how one variable moves in relation to another.

## Visualizations

### a. Relationship between Degree and Income Level

We plot the relationship between the degree and income level to see if there's any correlation between educational background and income.

### b. Relationship between Degree and Marital Situation

We explore the relationship between the degree and marital situation to understand if there's any association between educational background and marital status.

### c. Relationship between Income Level and Having Child Status

We investigate the relationship between income level and having child status to see if there's any difference in income based on parental status.

## Product Purchases Analysis

We create a pie chart to visualize which product customers purchase more, providing insights into their purchasing behavior.

## Conclusion

Overall, the visualizations and analysis provide valuable insights into the dataset, allowing X company to make informed decisions based on customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

## Stretch Goals

For stretch goals, we can handle outliers using different strategies, add linear regression analysis to the notebook, and explore any patterns or anomalies in the data for deeper insights.
